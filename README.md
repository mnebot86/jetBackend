# JetBackend

JetBackend serves as the backbone for the Jet application, providing essential RESTful APIs for JetFrontend. This backend system facilitates user creation, CRUD operations for players, age groups, videos, game schedules, and messages. It employs a tech stack that includes Node.js, TypeScript, Mongoose, MongoDB, socket.io, jest, supertest, and Express.

## Tech Stack

JetBackend relies on the following technologies and tools:

- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.

- **TypeScript (TS)**: A typed superset of JavaScript, ensuring robust code development.

- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB to simplify database interactions.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for data storage and retrieval.

- **socket.io**: Facilitating real-time communication between clients and the server.

- **jest**: A popular testing framework for unit and integration testing.

- **supertest**: Used for testing HTTP requests and responses.

- **Express**: A web application framework for creating robust APIs.
